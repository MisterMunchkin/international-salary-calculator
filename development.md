Take any salary rate and convert to hourly first

Annual salary to hourly wage = (base / 52 weeks) / number of hours per week 

Monthly salary to hourly wage = ((base * 12) / 52 weeks) / number of hours per week

Weekly salary to hourly wage = base / number of hours per week

Daily salary to hourly wage = base / 8 hours

After converting to hourly we can convert the rest of the rates using 

hourly = hourly

daily = hourly * (number of hours per week / 5) **assuming days worked per week is 5. This is a constant

weekly = hourly * number of hours per week

Monthly = (hourly * number of hours per week * 52) / 12

Annually = hourly * number of hours per week * 52
